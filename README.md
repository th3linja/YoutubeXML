# YoutubeXML
Use Youtube API to write a custom XML file for MRSS feed.

## Getting Started
The purpose of this project was to create a script that converted a youtube channel into an XML file per client request. This script is not per standard use but could provide some insights or serve as a template to similar projects.

## Prerequisites
* Python
* xml.etree
* googleapiclient.discovery
* pytube

## Running Tests
* Replace `API_KEY` with your Youtube API Key
* Replace the current Youtube channel ID with the one intended
